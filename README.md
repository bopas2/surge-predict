# Uber Surge Prediction Web Application 

Surge Surfer uses past data and current traffic information to help you make informed decisions about when to call a rideshare. Our machine learning algorithms trained on millions of Lyft rides, help us predict when ride-sharing platforms will surge their prices, so you can travel for less. 

To view our webapp and try it yourself, go to http://ec2-3-9-179-236.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/. In addition to our website, we have an Android app. Both of these platforms allow for easy text notifications and help you get the best ride on your time!
